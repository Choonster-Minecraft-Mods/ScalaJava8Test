This is a Minecraft Forge 1.8 mod I've made to test combining Java 8 and Scala in a single project.

Compilation currently fails because SBT and scalac don't support Java 8 code (though recent versions can output Java 8 bytecode). Scala 2.12 will require Java 8, so hopefully it will be able to compile Java 8 code.
